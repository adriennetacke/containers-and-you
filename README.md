# Containers & You: The Azure Edition - Adrienne Tacke - Code Samples

Thanks for coming to my talk Containers & You: The Azure Edition!

I've gathered my code samples into this convenient repository just in case you wanted to try the demos yourselves, on your own time. These samples assume that you at least have an Azure account and an Azure subscription set up.
I used the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) for my demos, so be sure to install that too (if you haven't already)! 

Don't hesitate to open issues for this repo or [Tweet @ Me](https://twitter.com/AdrienneTacke) if you have any questions!
